RealRTCW on iortcw

This fork of iortcw contains changes made by wolfETplayer for his RealRTCW mod in version 2.0 which is available on windows only.

I transferred the changes to iortcw, for itâ€™s more actively maintained by including changes from ioquake3 and it is easy available on more platforms than Microsoft Windows.

The code should compile like the iortcw source. Tested at the moment just for Mac x86_64 with XCode 7, using make-macosx_xcode5.sh.


This fork contains the source for the binary only, z_realrtcw.pk3 is not included, and remains in the original RealRTCW 2.0 mod. But it is required to play this mod.

The changes are made to the SP part only, MP is left untouched.
